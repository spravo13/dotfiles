Spencer's Dotfiles
========

configuration files that I use to modify my Crunchbang computer to my liking. All changes I have made are to my own opinion of efficiency and looks, feel free to use and/or modify how you wish.

## Installation

First you have to download the files by using:

	git clone git://github.com/spravo13/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles

After the files have been downloaded you need to link the files to where the
system looks for them: (i.e.):

	ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim
